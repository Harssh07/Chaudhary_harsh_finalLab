            <p class="lb_text">
              
              Sean Johnson (Born: 1966), known as Sweet, is the leader of the Grove Street Families and the older brother of Carl, Kendl and Brian. He has an unnamed girlfriend. Sweet is initially skeptical about Carl's loyalty, blaming him for the death of Brian, but eventually accepts his brother back into the gang. He is arrested by the police, before being released after Mike Toreno arranged for his release in return for a favor from Carl. He returns to his home in Ganton and helps to re-assert the Grove Street Families dominance in the area.

                He welcomes Carl's return to the gang and assists Carl in helping the Grove Street Families return to dominance. However, he does so in a limited way, later joining forces with the Ballas, the Grove Street Families' main rival, in order to become involved in the drugs trade, which Sweet had refused to do. He also works in league with the Los Santos Vagos, Russian Mafia and the San Fierro Rifa. Whilst Carl is away from Los Santos, he becomes the city's drug baron and hides himself in a building in Los Flores. He is later killed by Carl for betraying the Grove Street Families.
